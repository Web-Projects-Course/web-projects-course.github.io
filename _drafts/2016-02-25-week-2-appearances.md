This week we will dive into CSS, looking at how to grab the different elements of our HTML and change their appearance. Also we will go over some the details of dealing with layout in CSS and the quirks of each layout.

Also we will introduce our first project which will focus exclusively on CSS and some approaches other artists have used in transforming text into new works.
