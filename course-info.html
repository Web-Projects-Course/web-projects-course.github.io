    <p class="lead">Labeled a village, a frontier, a highway, a commons, a global brain, the cloud, and a series of tubes, the internet and its constituent technologies have been described by many metaphors. Used as explantory tools, metaphors are often useful in grounding abstract technical concepts, guiding users toward possible uses. They can also serve as political or artistics contraints. </p>

    <p class="lead">This course explores the theoretical and practical framework of the internet and its most common interface, the web. We will use metaphor as our compass in navigating this vast subject. The heart of the course will be a series web-based projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Students are encourage to interpret the web as an experimental platform and as a subject of contemporary culture.</p>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

<p>In the first half of the course, we focus on learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Projects and exercises will focus on this task. In the second half, we look at additional web tools that relate specifically to the work and interests of the students, culminating in a final project of the student's choosing.</p>

<h3>Learning together</h3>

<p>Learning new technologies can be daunting and so a key element of this course will be learning to use each other and the broader internet community as a resource. In class we will conduct short demonstrations followed by hands-on collaborative exercises. Outside of class we will share found resources and techniques in an online forum.</p>

<h3>Artistic possibilities</h3>

<p>Throughout the course we will address how our work fits into the broader conversation on the internet. We will survey artists and designers using the web as an expressive medium and we will also look at ways to push web-based work beyond the screen.</p>

<h2>Expectations</h2>

<h3>Attendance</h3>
<p>Because collaborative learning is so central to this course, attendance is critical to your success. If sickness or other personal reasons prevent your attendance please contact the instructor as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Plagerism</h3>
<p>Issues of appropriation, reproduction and reuse will be a conceptual problem of this course. In the interest of academic honesty, students should keep track of the sources of the materials, text and code they use in their coursework. Please include a list of sources and citations used with any completed work.</p>
